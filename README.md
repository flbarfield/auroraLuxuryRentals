<h2>Summary</h2>
Built for a client's Airbnb and luxury home rental business in the making, this landing page will serve as a foundation for their web presence once they get up and running. Created through the use of **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**.

---
<h2>Optimizations</h2>
Until my client is ready to launch their business, this served as more of a paid demo that they could bring to their team. When they go live, I intend on adding more pages that will ultimately help book the rental homes they'll be acquiring in Alaska. The main focus will be on how the location is an absolute outdoorsman's paradise, detailing scenic views and places to hunt and fish. I'm hoping I'd even find a feed that would detail local events that will be happening in the area to create more of a draw during their busiest seasons.

<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
This was my first project for a paid client. As such, I learned a lot about how to draft contracts and proposals and really loved how the client responded with each new iteration of the website that I've brought to them. It was extremely satisfying to be able to create their vision from nothing, and they were pleased with how much I included them in the process, so they're quite excited to work with me again in the future!
